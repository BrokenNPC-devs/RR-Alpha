-L3rn 2 Script
 
 - Understand the basics of scripting in Unity: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting
 
  - You don't have to watch everything, but you should at least get through the first half of beginner stuff

 - Read through some of the UnityEngine classes: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html
 
  - Again, you don't have to read through the whole thing, but at least familiarize yourself with Physics2D & Rigidbody2D

# You're Ready! Now what?

- Create and upload a folder named after your task

- You should have the following inside the folder
 
 1) A .cs file containing the most recent version of your script

 2) A .txt file containing any essential information that a designer would need to know prior to reading the script 
 
 - If you're confuze, take a look at the "Player-Movement" folder
 
# UmadBro?

- If you ever get stuck while scripting or something, read through the Unity Scripting API and look for a class that might help(link above)

- If you still find yourself struggling, try to play around with some of the different options inside unity (like collisions matrix, physics effectors, inputs, etc)
 
- If you find that doesn't help, google and reddit are your best friends

- If that doesn't help, you might want to ask other devs for help and reconsider they way you're approaching the problem

# Congrats! You read this whole thing!

- Now get to wurk

:)
