  - You don't have to watch everything, but you should at least get through the first half of beginner stuff

 - Read through some of the UnityEngine classes: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html
 
  - Again, you don't have to read through the whole thing, but at least familiarize yourself with Physics2D & Rigidbody2D

# Your Ready! Now what?

- Create and upload a folder named after your task

- You should have the following inside the folder
 
 1) A .cs file containing the most recent version of your script

 2) A .txt file containing any essential information that a designer would need to know prior to reading the script 
 
 - If you're confuze, take a look at the "Player-Movement" 
 
# UmadBro?

- If you ever get stuck while scripting or something, google and reddit are your best friends
 
- If you find that reddit or google arn't helping, you might want to consider rethinking what you're doing
 
- Don't forget to always ask other devs for help when you need it!

# Congrats! You read this whole thing!

- Now get working
