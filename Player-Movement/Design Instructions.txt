Layers: 

- Make layer 8 the "player" layer, R and all her children objects should be on that layer

- Make layer 9 the "platform" layer, all platforms should be on this layer

- Make layer 10 the "ground" layer, the ground should be on this layer

Colliders: 

- R should be a 2D box collider 

- All platforms should be 2D edge colliders

	1) Check the "Used By Effector" Box

	2) Add "Platform Effector 2D"

	3) Check the "Use One Way" Box

	4) Make the "Surface Arc" 90 degrees (Tweakable)

- Make the ground whatever kind of collider you want, except for slants, slants are stupid

	- Slants should be 2D edge colliders
		
		1) Check the "Used By Effector" Box"
		
		2) Add "Surface Effector 2D"
		
		3) Tweak "speed," "speed variation," and "force scale" to your liking
		
		4) If you have walls in the same scene check "Use Bounce" while your at it

- Walls should be 2D edge colliders

	**Skip these steps if you have slants in the same scene and you followed those steps **
	
	1) Add "Surface Effector 2D"
	
	2) Check "Use Bounce"

Grounding:

- Click on the link below and skip to 54:45, watch until 56:30

	1) Create empty Game Objects "Platform Check" and "Ground Check"
	
	2) Attach a visual aid to the objects so you can see them
	
	3) Make the objects R's children
	
	3) Attach "Platform Check" object to "Platform Check" public variable (should be under "Movement Script" in 
	
	   components). Attach "Ground Check" object to "Ground Check" public variable.
	
	5) Make "whatIsGround" the ground layer and "whatIsPlatform" the platform layer.
