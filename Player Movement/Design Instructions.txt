Layers: 

- Make layer 8 the "player" layer, R and all her children objects should be on that layer

- Make layer 9 the "platform" layer, all platforms should be on this layer

Colliders: 

- R should be a 2D box collider 

- All platforms should be 2D edge colliders

	1) Check the "Used By Effector" Box

	2) Add "Platform Effector 2D"

	3) Check the "Use One Way" Box

	4) Make the "Surface Arc" 90 degrees (Tweakable)

- Make the ground whatever kind of collider you want

Grounding:

- Click on the link below and skip to 54:45, watch until 56:30

	- Put the child object as described in the video into "Ground Check"

	- "whatIsGround" in our case is called "Ground" and the only things that should be called ground are the default layer (where the physical ground is) and the platform layer
